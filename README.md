I's ultimately designed around comfort, convenience, and a comprehensive standard libraryâ€”so comprehensive that it's planned to have a cross-platform graphics API, wrappings for internet protocols (including low-level ones, like ICMP), and even a built-in cross-platform way to interact with peripheral devices.

The syntax folder contains the syntactic design of the language. It's currently incomplete (as you'll notice, with some TODOs scattered around). Contributions are highly appreciated!
