I's ultimately designed around comfort, convenience, and a comprehensive standard libraryâ€”so comprehensive that it's planned to have a cross-platform graphics API, wrappings for internet protocols (including low-level ones, like ICMP), and even a built-in cross-platform way to interact with peripheral devices.

syntax.md contains the syntactic design of the language. It's currently incomplete (as you'll notice, with some TODOs scattered around). Contributions are highly appreciated!
