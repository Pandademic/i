Blocks, are groups of expressions where the last expression is returned; they must be indented by the same amount of the same whitespace character: either spaces or tabs. `do expression` can be used in place of blocks.

## Example
`if` expression with a block expression:

```
if x
	expression1
	expression2
	etc
```
